# Forecasting the 2024 U.S Presidential Election Through Probit Regression Anaylsis and Bayesian Modelling

## Overview

The 2024 Presidential Election is shaping up to be a highly competitive race between candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. The purpose of this repo is to using linear models to forecast the outcome of this race and provides a comprehensive overview of the sampling methodologies pollsters such as New York Times and Siena College employs. 


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from the website Fivethirtyeight.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of GPT-4o. The entire chat history is available in other/llm_usage/usage.txt.
